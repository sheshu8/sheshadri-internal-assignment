    <br>
    <p1 align = "center">Mental health includes our <u>emotional, psychological, and social well-being</u>. It affects how we think feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. 1. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p1>

    <p2>Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes.
<br>
<br>
        Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. People with mental health conditions are more likely to experience lower levels of mental well-being, but this is not always or necessarily the case.</p2>
